<h1>Beer and Wine</h1>
<h5>Meet ShackMeister® Ale, otherwise known as the ShackBurger’s best friend.  Our team collaborated with Brooklyn Brewery to create this stellar beer.  We think it’s a brew surely worthy of our eats with its deep golden color, bright citrus aroma, slight bitterness and bready malt flavor.  If wine’s more your style, our incredible house red and white (made exclusively for Shake Shack by Napa Valley’s celebrated Frog’s Leap) are patiently waiting for you to take notice.</h5>
